To visualize these lotteries, imagine rolling two 10-sided dice to generate a number from 1 to 100. In Option A, the first 40 numbers pay $5, the next 30 numbers pay $7, and the last 30 numbers pay $19. In Option B the first half of the numbers pay $3 and the other half pay $25. If this is the question to determine your payment, we would roll the dice and pay you according to which number is rolled. Your task is simply to choose the lottery you prefer. The computer will record your choice and then will bring you to the next decision.<br><br>
