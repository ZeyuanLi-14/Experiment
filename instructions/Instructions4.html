<p>
There are <b>no “right” or “wrong” answers</b> in these questions. We are interested in people’s preferences over these rules, so we simply want to know which rules you like and which you don’t. Since we want to know people’s true preferences, the payment is set up such that you’ll be paid your “favorite” thing if you answer truthfully. Therefore, you have no incentive to answer differently from what you really think. If you think the rule should describe your choices, you should select it (and then you’ll save the cost of making the decision on your own). If you think there are situations where the rule would not give you your favorite option, you should not select it.
