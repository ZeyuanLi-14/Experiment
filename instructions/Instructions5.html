<p>
You will also be making choices between “lotteries.” A lottery specifies the chance of receiving certain payoffs. In this experiment, the possible payoffs will range from $0 to $12. The chance of each payoff can be anything from 0% to 100%.

<p>
For example, one lottery could give you an 80% chance of $18, 10% chance of $7, and a 10% chance of $4. Another lottery might give a 100% chance of $13. There are many different possible lotteries. In each decision, you will see two or three lotteries on your screen. Your screen will display the written values for the payoffs and probabilities in a table.
