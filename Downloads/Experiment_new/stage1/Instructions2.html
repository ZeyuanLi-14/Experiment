<p>
Simply choose the lottery you prefer! In any given decision, if it’s the decision to determine your payment, we will give you the lottery you selected. So you should select the lottery that you’d rather have to determine your payment. There are <b>no “right” or “wrong” answers</b> in these questions. We are interested in people’s preferences over these lotteries, so we simply want to know which lotteries you prefer. These lotteries are not the same questions as the lotteries which would determine your payment from your “rule” decisions.
