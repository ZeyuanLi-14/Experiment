<p>
    In this stage you will make several more decisions on lotteries, which will be presented in the same way as in the previous stage.

</p>

<p>
    Your task is simply to choose the lottery you prefer. The computer will record your choice and then will bring you to the next decision.

</p>

<p>
    Each decision will be presented on a different screen. Along with all decisions you make in this experiment, each of your lottery decisions is equally likely to be paid, and we will roll dice at the end of the experiment to determine which decision will be paid.
