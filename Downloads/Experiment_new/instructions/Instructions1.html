<p>This is an experiment in the economics of decision-making. This experiment has four different parts, and each part has many decisions.</p>

<p>You will receive $3 for completing the experiment. In addition, you have a 20% chance of earning a bonus.
    Your bonus is based on your choice in exactly <b>ONE</b> randomly selected decision from the entire experiment.

    Since each decision has an equal chance of being chosen for payment, it is in your best interest to consider every question thoroughly to maximize your potential earnings. </p>

<p>For each part, we will explain how you would be paid from a decision in that part. The decision chosen to determine your payment will be shown at the end of the experiment, and we will realize the lottery you chose to determine your final payoff. </p>
