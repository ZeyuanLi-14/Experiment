<p>
In the first part of the experiment, you indicated which “rules” you liked and which ones you did not like. In the second part of the experiment, you made choices over lotteries. It’s possible that you selected a rule in Part 1 which could have been applied to make one of your choices in Part 2.
    </p>
<p>
In this final part of the experiment, you will have the opportunity to reevaluate your choices. We will show you if you ever selected a rule and then made lottery choices which were not what the rule would have chosen for you. This way, you can analyze the rule and the choices together. You might decide that you want to change your lottery choices to align with what the rule would have chosen for you. Or you might decide that the rule isn’t always true of your choices, so you can “un-select” it. Or, you can leave your choices as they were.
