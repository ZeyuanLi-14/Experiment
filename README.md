# Experiment Overview (updated)

This experiment is designed to explore decision-making processes under varying levels of complexity, focusing on the alignment between individuals' choices and microeconomic axioms. The experiment consists of four stages, incorporating two treatments that differ in the complexity of questions posed to participants. Here's a breakdown of the experiment's structure:

## Stage 1: Introduction to Microeconomic Axioms
- Participants are introduced to four microeconomic axioms.
- They are asked to make decisions about lotteries, either independently or based on the axioms provided.

## Stage 2: Lottery Choices and Complexity Variation
- This stage is for participants who selected at least one axiom in Stage 1.
- Participants make lottery choices that may conflict with the axioms they chose.
- Randomly, half of the participants are presented with a set of more complex questions, while the other half receive a standard set.

## Stage 3: Re-evaluation of Decisions
- If participants' choices conflict with their selected axioms from Stage 1, they are given a chance to reconsider.
- They can either change their answer from Stage 2 or "unselect" their initially chosen axiom.

## Stage 4: Additional Lottery Questions
- All participants are given additional questions about lottery choices.
- These questions maintain the same structure and complexity level as those in Stage 2.

The aim is to observe how different levels of question complexity affect participants' adherence to economic axioms and whether the opportunity for re-evaluation influences their decision-making process.
